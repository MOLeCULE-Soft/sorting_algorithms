Big O Notation: It's a way to describe how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It helps in understanding how efficient an algorithm is. For instance,
O(1) means constant time (always takes the same time)
O(n) means linear time (time grows linearly with input size), and
O(n2) means quadratic time (time grows quadratically with input size).
